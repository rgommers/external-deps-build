# Contributing guidelines

The main purpose of the code and content in this repository is to experiment
with the design of PEP 725 and potential follow-up work around a name mapping
mechanism for PyPI/Python. The code is therefore "research quality" rather than
production-quality. When considering a contribution to this repository, please
consider the following guidelines:

- Questions, comments, bug reports regarding the methodology or implementation
  of it and new feature suggestions are very welcome - please feel free to open
  a new issue.
- Before opening a pull request with nontrivial changes to the current code,
  please open an issue to discuss first.
- Please refrain from pull requests that deal with stylistic and non-critical
  code quality issues.
